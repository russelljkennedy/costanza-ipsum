I feel like my old self again: totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic - it's a pleasure.
This is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
Well there's nothing dirtier than a big ball of oil.
The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
My life is the complete opposite of everything I want to be.
So that's one tuck, and one no tuck.
You know, if you take everything I've done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word - nothing.
Who buys an umbrella anyway - you can get them for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
Feel - what's that?
I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy.
If she can't find me, she can't break up with me.
Lunch is fine at the beginning, then you move on to dinner. You don't move back to lunch - it's like being demoted.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time.
I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs.
The mug is round, the jar is round - they should call it Roundtine.
Believe it or not, George isn't home, please leave a message at the beep, I must be out or I'd pick up the phone, where could I be?
It's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes.
But I'm disturbed, I'm depressed, I'm inadequate: I've got it all!
Well, the jerk-store called, and they're running out of you.
A man without hand is not a man.
I proclaim this the summer of George!
My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
This was supposed to be the summer of George!
