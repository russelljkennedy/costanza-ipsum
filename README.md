## Costanza Ipsum
### A simple ipsum generator dedicated to George C.

I put together this random ipsum generator for fun, and to help build example sites filled with Costanza-isms.

It's built using jQuery, which is probably a bit boring, but does more or less everything I need it to. I also added a JavaScript function so that any text copied goes over to the clipboard in plain text format.

Anyhow, I hope you find myriad uses for George's pearls of wisdom.

Serenity now!
